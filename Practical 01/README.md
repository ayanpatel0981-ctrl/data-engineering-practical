# Practical 1: Data Ingestion, Binary File Processing, Regex Wrangling & Relational Databases

**Author:** Ayan Patel

## 1. Aim
To master foundational data engineering techniques in Python:
1. Parsing heterogeneous multi-format files (Text, CSV, HTML, XML, JSON) and detecting anomalies.
2. Binary file serialization and deserialization using the `struct` module.
3. String manipulation, pattern matching, and validation using Regular Expressions (`re`).
4. Relational database schema design and executing full SQL CRUD operations using SQLite.

---

## 2. Brief Theory
Data engineering begins with robust data acquisition and preparation:
- **Semi-Structured Ingestion:** Different data providers serve data in varied formats. Data engineers must parse JSON, XML, HTML, and CSV while implementing anomaly filters for missing or corrupted entries.
- **Binary Data Encoding:** Storing data as raw binary using format strings (`<i10sf`) minimizes memory consumption and enables fast I/O.
- **Pattern Matching (Regex):** Text wrangling, log tokenization, and format standardization require regular expressions.
- **Relational Modeling (RDBMS):** Structured business data requires relational guarantees (ACID transactions, primary/foreign keys, referential integrity, and SQL CRUD queries).
