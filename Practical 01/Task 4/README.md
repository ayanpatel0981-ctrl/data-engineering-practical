# Practical 1 - Task 4: Relational Database Schema & CRUD Operations

**Author:** Ayan Patel

---

## 1. Aim
To design a relational database schema, populate it with records, enforce relational constraints, and execute SQL CRUD operations using SQLite.

---

## 2. Brief Theory
Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) organize data into normalized tables with strict schema enforcement:
- **Schema Design & Integrity:**
  - `PRIMARY KEY`: Uniquely identifies each record.
  - `FOREIGN KEY`: Establishes parent-child relationships and maintains referential integrity.
  - `ON DELETE CASCADE`: Automatically propagates deletions from parents to related child records.
- **CRUD Operations:**
  - **Create:** `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT INTO`
  - **Read:** `SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... JOIN ... GROUP BY`
  - **Update:** `UPDATE ... SET ... WHERE`
  - **Delete:** `DELETE FROM ... WHERE`
- **Joins & Aggregations:** Multi-table joins (`INNER JOIN`) correlate entities, while `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`) compute summary statistics.

## 5. Conclusion
Successfully modeled a relational college database with departments, students, courses, and enrollments tables. Enforced referential integrity via foreign keys and cascade deletions, and performed complete SQL CRUD operations.
